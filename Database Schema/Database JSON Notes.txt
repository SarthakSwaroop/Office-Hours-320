Professor Open Office Hours

Have all times for each day be in 1 string, separate start and end times with "-" and different sessions with " "

If there are no times for a day, assign that day null

Each row will have a primary key of the professors name


-----------------
Student Rank Choice Voting


Using student ID for now, subject to change based on how we do authentication

Assuming students can select their top 3 selections (changing this shouldn't be hard) 

These times should obviously match up with those given by their professor





------------------
Student Class Schedule

OpenTime
then a dash to split the two times
CloseTime
then an X
then the name of the class
and then a space if there is another class after

OpenTime-CloseTimeXclassName

null if there are no classes on that day


-------------------
Student Availible Time

Same structure as prof office hours, this time obviously shouldn't conflict with their free time


-------------------

Student Info

The login info is still subject to change, but for now it'll just store ID, Name, and Password
