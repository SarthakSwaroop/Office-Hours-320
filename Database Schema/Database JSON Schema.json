// I currently have this as 1 big object, but tbh I'd probably prefer it as individual ones
//I'm mainly sending it as 1 so I only have to send 1 file.
// So if it's a huge pain to split them, def keep it as 1, I'm sure we can pull stuff out later to add to the database
// But if you could make each individual file from one generation that'd be huge
// Thank you for switching this all up, I know it's annoying to constantly change this
